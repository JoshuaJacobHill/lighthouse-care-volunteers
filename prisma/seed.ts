Lighthouse Care is a not-for-profit charity based in Logan, South East Queensland. Founded in 2004 by Debbie and Ron Hill, our mission is simple: making lives better so that together we can make the world better.

Each year, we support over 750,000 people across South East Queensland through affordable groceries, $25 trolleys, home delivery, and emergency food relief. We run two not-for-profit grocery stores — in Loganholme and Hillcrest — and an online store with home delivery. Every dollar raised through our stores goes directly back into funding free food relief for families doing it tough.

We are entirely self-funded. There is no recurring government funding. That makes the role of every volunteer critical to what we do.

You are joining a team of passionate, generous people who believe that everyone deserves to eat well — regardless of their circumstances. We are so glad you are here.`,

Everything we do is guided by six cultural pillars:

PEOPLE — Our community is at the heart of everything. We treat every person — shopper, recipient, donor, or volunteer — with warmth, dignity, and respect.

EMPOWERING — We believe in building people up. Our goal is not just to provide food, but to help families regain stability and confidence.

GENEROSITY — We give freely. Our stores operate on a low-margin model so that more people can afford nutritious food, and surplus funds emergency food relief at no cost.

INTEGRITY — We do what we say. We are transparent, honest, and accountable in all we do.

HOPE — We believe every family's situation can improve. We hold hope for the people we serve, even when things are hard.

COLLABORATION — We work together — with volunteers, churches, schools, councils, and other charities — because we know we achieve more side by side.

As a volunteer, you represent these values every time you walk through our doors or interact with a community member. The way you greet someone, serve them, or simply make eye contact matters more than you might think.`,

- PACKING TEAM: Sorting and packing donated and purchased goods into food relief hampers for families in crisis.
- WAREHOUSE TEAM: Receiving stock deliveries, managing storage, and preparing orders for distribution.
- DELIVERY TEAM: Transporting food parcels to families who cannot travel to our stores (valid driver's licence required).
- EVENTS TEAM: Assisting with community events, fundraisers, and awareness campaigns.
- ADMIN TEAM: Supporting office functions including data entry, phones, and coordination.

Regardless of your role, every volunteer is expected to:
- Arrive on time and sign in using the kiosk at the start of your shift.
- Sign out when you leave so we can accurately record your contribution.
- Wear your volunteer lanyard or badge while on-site.
- Treat all community members, staff, and fellow volunteers with kindness and respect.

WHEN YOU ARRIVE:
1. Go to the volunteer kiosk (tablet) at the front of your location.
2. Search for your name or scan your QR code (if provided).
3. Confirm your details and tap "Sign In".
4. You'll see a confirmation screen — you're officially on shift!

WHEN YOU LEAVE:
1. Return to the kiosk before you leave.
2. Find your name and tap "Sign Out".
3. Confirm the time is correct.

If you forget to sign in or out, please let a staff member know as soon as possible so they can manually record your attendance.

GUEST SIGN-IN:
If you're bringing a friend or family member to help for the day (a "one-off" volunteer), they must also sign in using the Guest sign-in on the kiosk. They'll need to provide their name, mobile number, and acknowledge the safety notice.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Accurate attendance records help us:
- Celebrate volunteer milestones (hours, anniversaries)
- Report impact to donors and the community
- Identify and follow up with volunteers who may need support
- Fulfil our duty of care obligations`,

PERSONAL HYGIENE:
- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water when you arrive, after handling bins or waste, after using the bathroom, and before handling food.
- If hand washing facilities are not immediately available, use the hand sanitiser provided at each station.
- Do not handle food if you are unwell. If you are experiencing symptoms of illness (nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, or a fever), please stay home and notify your shift coordinator as soon as possible.
- Keep hair tied back and avoid wearing loose jewellery when working in the packing or warehouse areas.
- Wear gloves when handling open food products or when instructed by a staff member.

FOOD HANDLING:
- Do not consume food products from the stock area without permission.
- Never place food items on the floor — use trolleys, shelving, or benches.
- Check the "best before" and "use by" dates on all products. Flag anything that appears damaged, leaking, or past its date to a staff member immediately.
- Hot or chilled items must be stored correctly. If in doubt, ask.
- Do not accept food from the public to pass on to recipients unless explicitly approved by a team leader.

CROSS-CONTAMINATION:
- Keep raw and ready-to-eat foods separate.
- Use colour-coded equipment (cutting boards, gloves) if available.
- Clean and sanitise surfaces before and after food preparation.

If you are unsure about any aspect of food safety, please ask a staff member before proceeding. It is always better to check than to guess.`,

- Use personal protective equipment (PPE) where provided (e.g. gloves, high-visibility vests in the warehouse).

MANUAL HANDLING:
- Ask for help when lifting heavy or awkward items.
- Bend at the knees, not the back, when lifting.
- Use trolleys and hand trucks where available.
- Never try to lift more than you are comfortable with.

EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:
- Familiarise yourself with the emergency exits at your location on your first shift.
- In the event of a fire or emergency evacuation: leave immediately via the nearest exit, do not stop to collect belongings, and assemble at the designated muster point (signposted outside the building).
- Emergency contacts and first aid kits are located at the customer service desk.
- If someone is injured, do not move them unless they are in immediate danger. Call 000 if required and notify a staff member immediately.

- Do not make assumptions about why someone is in need of support.
- Use respectful, everyday language. Avoid labels like "the needy", "the poor", or "charity cases".

WORKING WITH CHILDREN:
Some volunteer roles may involve incidental contact with children (e.g. children accompanying parents while shopping). If your role involves direct, regular, or unsupervised contact with children under 18, you will be required to hold a current Queensland Blue Card before commencing that work.

WHAT IS A BLUE CARD?
A Blue Card (Working with Children Check) is issued by Blue Card Services Queensland and verifies that an individual is suitable to work with children. It is a legal requirement for many volunteer roles in Queensland.

If you need a Blue Card:
1. Apply online at www.bluecard.qld.gov.au (volunteer applications are free).
2. Provide your Blue Card number to the Lighthouse Care admin team once issued.
3. Your Blue Card must remain current. It expires every three years.

CHILD SAFE BEHAVIOUR:
- Never be alone with a child in an isolated area.
- Do not take photos of children under any circumstances.
- If a child discloses abuse or makes you concerned for their safety, notify a staff member immediately and do not attempt to investigate yourself.
- Report any concerns about child safety to the Lighthouse Care coordinator or, in an emergency, to the Queensland Police Service on 000.

Our commitment is not just legal compliance — it is a genuine belief that every child deserves to be safe.`,

      content: `Being part of the Lighthouse Care volunteer team means you are part of our community. We want you to feel welcome, informed, and connected.

STAYING IN TOUCH:
- The Lighthouse Care admin team will communicate with you via the email address you registered with. Please check your email regularly.
- We will send you shift reminders, updates, and occasional newsletters. You can manage your communication preferences in your volunteer profile.
- If your contact details change, please update them in the volunteer portal as soon as possible.

CANCELLING A SHIFT:
Life happens. If you need to cancel a shift, please let us know as soon as possible — ideally at least 24 hours before. You can cancel via the volunteer portal, or call/email the coordinator at your location. Last-minute cancellations without notice make it difficult for us to find a replacement and may leave a team short-staffed.

CONDUCT EXPECTATIONS:
- Be respectful to all staff, volunteers, and community members at all times.
- Do not use offensive, discriminatory, or inappropriate language on-site.
- Mobile phones should be on silent during shifts. Personal calls should be taken on breaks.
- Do not be under the influence of alcohol or substances while volunteering.
- Volunteers who breach our Code of Conduct may be asked to leave and may not be invited back.

SOCIAL MEDIA:
- Please do not post photos or information about Lighthouse Care operations, staff, or community members without permission.
- If you'd like to share your experience, feel free to post general positives (e.g. "Loved volunteering at Lighthouse Care today!") but always respect confidentiality.

We are one team. How we treat each other and the people we serve is our greatest statement of who we are.`,

COMPLETING YOUR INDUCTION:
Once you have read all sections and passed the short quiz that follows, your status will be updated to "Inducted" and a coordinator will be in touch to arrange your first shift.

YOUR FIRST SHIFT:
- Arrive 10 minutes early so you can meet the team.
- Bring your volunteer lanyard or confirm your name is in the system.
- Wear comfortable, enclosed footwear — open-toed shoes are not permitted in the warehouse or packing areas.
- Let the shift coordinator know you are new — they will introduce you to the team and walk you through the day.

GETTING SUPPORT:
If you have questions, concerns, or need to take a break from volunteering, please reach out. We understand that life has seasons, and we would rather you tell us than simply disappear.

Contact the volunteer coordinator at your preferred location:
- Loganholme: volunteers@lighthousecare.org.au
- Hillcrest: volunteers@lighthousecare.org.au

Your volunteer profile on this portal lets you:
- Update your personal details and availability
- View your upcoming shifts
- Track your volunteer hours
- Update your communication preferences

Thank you again for your generosity. What you are about to do matters — more than you may ever fully know. Together, we are making lives better.

    <p>If your circumstances have changed and you'd like to pause or step back from volunteering for a while, please let us know so we can update your profile.</p>
